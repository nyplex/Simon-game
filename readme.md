<h1 align="center">SIMON GAME</h1>

*This is the README file for SIMON game web application. You will find here a bunch of information regarding the Design, the technologies used and some informations regarding the gameplay.*

Simon is a memory game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The game creates a series of tones and lights and requres a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs our, the game is over. 

Simon 2.0, is a web based application game that I have created. I took the concept of the original game and translate it into the web environment. 

In Simon 2.0, the user has the possibility to choose a theme, a game mode, a level of difficulty. The game can ben played with up to 4 people. 

The main goal during the user's visit is fun and entertainment. I want the user to enjoy theirt time on the app and I want them to come back.

For the first-time player, I have written a set of rules that explain how to the game work.
