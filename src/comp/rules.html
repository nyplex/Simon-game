                When the game starts, Simon will give you the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color.

            <li>
                Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

            <li>
                If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds (10 seconds from level 4) to repeat a signal, Simon responds with "BUZZZZ" sound. This means you've lost and the sequence of signal ends.
